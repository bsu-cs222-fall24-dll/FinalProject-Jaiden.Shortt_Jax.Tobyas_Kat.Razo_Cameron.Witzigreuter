# Final Project: Speedrun.com Leaderboard Changes
This project shows a user recent changes to a leaderboard in any category of any game. Results can be filtered by top position and sorted by a few methods.

The first iteration will allow users to lookup the top 10-20 speedrunners on a given leaderboard. It will run in the Command-Line Interface.
The second iteration will allow users to see time splits on a given speedrun. It will run in a JavaFX GUI.
The third iteration will provide users a timer to record their own time splits. It will run in a JavaFX GUI.
